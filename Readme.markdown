### Notes

#### Core Data

This uses [mogenerator](https://github.com/rentzsch/mogenerator). Not part of
the project, but will need to be installed on the machine if changes are made to
the model.

After any changes to the model, run the `cd_generate` script in the root of the
project to update the Machine generated files.
